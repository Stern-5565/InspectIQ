# AI_MEMORY

Running log of architectural decisions and their reasoning, kept up to date every phase so a
future AI session (or the project owner) doesn't accidentally reverse a deliberate choice. Modeled
on PropertyManager's `documentation/progress-log.md`, which the owner found valuable for session
continuity on a long, multi-week build.

Do not delete entries here just because a phase is "done" — this file's value is historical
context, not a current-status board (see `AI_HANDOFF.md` for that).

## 2026-08-23 — Project started, Phase 1 (Architecture) in progress

- Project named **InspectIQ** (inspection + AI/OCR angle). Repo created at
  `C:\Users\shmil\Projects\InspectIQ`, deliberately outside OneDrive (owner's explicit instruction
  — avoids OneDrive file-lock/sync issues with `node_modules`, `.venv`, and SQLite/log files that
  change frequently during dev).
- Full scope document (22 numbered prompts + 20-phase build order) preserved verbatim in
  `docs/SCOPE.md`. Individual prompts split into `prompts/*.md` for quick reference, but
  `SCOPE.md` is the canonical source — if anything conflicts, `SCOPE.md` wins.
- Git identity set to match the PropertyManager repo (`Stern-5565` / `shmillystern@gmail.com`) for
  consistency across the owner's projects.
- Following the same working style validated on PropertyManager: real-DB testing (no mocks), one
  module = one commit with an honest message, verify before claiming done, phase-gate at natural
  checkpoints for owner review rather than running the entire 20-phase build unattended.

## 2026-08-23 — InspectionResponse snapshot strategy confirmed (PROJECT_PLAN.md §13.1)

Owner explicitly reviewed and confirmed the frozen-column snapshot approach over full
`InspectionTemplate` versioning, after asking specifically to be sure it wouldn't be regretted
later. Two mitigations were added as a direct result of that pushback, both **mandatory from
Phase 2, not optional**:

1. `InspectionQuestions`/Sections/Templates are soft-delete only — a hard delete would silently
   break the FK that the snapshot design deliberately keeps for analytics joins. Enforce at the
   repository layer (no `DELETE` statement against these tables), don't rely on convention alone.
2. `InspectionTemplate.Version` (bumped on any edit to it or its children) +
   `Inspections.TemplateVersionUsed` (captured at inspection-start). Not full version history —
   doesn't reconstruct what a past version looked like — but cheaply answers "which inspections
   predate/postdate this checklist change," which was the realistic gap in the frozen-column-only
   plan. If real template versioning is ever needed later, this column is exactly the backfill
   data a `TemplateVersions` table would need, so the migration path stays additive.

**Why this matters for future sessions**: if Phase 2's SQL ever ships without the soft-delete
enforcement or the `Version`/`TemplateVersionUsed` columns, that's a regression from an explicit,
reviewed decision — not a simplification to wave through in code review.

## 2026-08-23 — Phase 2 SQL written and verified against a real local SQL Server

All 25 tables, every deferred `CHECK` constraint, and 43 indexes now exist in a real local
`InspectIQDb` (`localhost\SQLEXPRESS`, Windows auth via `sqlcmd`) — not just designed on paper.
Verified with actual test inserts (valid/invalid data, FK violations, duplicate-unique
violations), not just "the script ran without error."

**The soft-delete-only requirement from the §13.1 sign-off is enforced by three
`INSTEAD OF DELETE` triggers**, not just a repository-layer convention as originally scoped —
upgraded during implementation to match the same "structural guarantee, not app convention"
principle already used for `RiskAssessments.RiskScore` (a `PERSISTED` computed column). Verified
live: a hard `DELETE` against `InspectionTemplates` is rejected and rolled back; `UPDATE ... SET
IsActive = 0` still works normally. If this ever needs undoing (e.g. a legitimate bulk-cleanup
tool), the correct approach is `DISABLE TRIGGER ... ON ...` for that one operation, not removing
the trigger.

**Two real SQL Server gotchas hit while writing the actual scripts** (not obvious from the design
doc, worth remembering for any future hand-written script against this schema — see
`AI_HANDOFF.md`'s "Important decisions" section for the fuller writeup):
1. `SET ANSI_NULLS ON` / `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON` are required in-session for any DDL or DML
   touching a table with a `PERSISTED` computed column or a filtered index — not just at table
   creation. The app's own DB driver (pyodbc/SQLAlchemy) sets these by default, but hand-written
   seed/fix scripts won't unless they say so explicitly.
2. Filtered index `WHERE` predicates don't support `NOT IN` — only `IN`, comparison operators,
   `IS NULL`/`IS NOT NULL`, and `AND`. Use `x <> a AND x <> b` instead of `x NOT IN (a, b)`.

**Interpretive design calls made while writing `09_Constraints.sql`**: the scope doc names a
"Status" field on `CleaningInspections`, `RiskAssessments`, and an "update type" on
`MaintenanceUpdates` without enumerating exact values (unlike `Inspections.Status` or
`MaintenanceIssues.Status`, which the scope spells out explicitly). Reasonable default enums were
chosen and marked `INTERPRETIVE` in the SQL comments — these are the one part of the Phase 2 SQL
that wasn't directly dictated by the scope doc, so worth a sanity check against real usage once
the app exists rather than treating them as immutable.
