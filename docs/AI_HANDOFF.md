# AI_HANDOFF

Current status. Overwrite/update this file at the end of every session or phase — unlike
`AI_MEMORY.md`, this one should reflect the *current* state, not history.

## What has been completed

- Repo scaffolded (`backend/`, `frontend/`, `database/`, `docs/`, `prompts/`), git initialized.
- Scope document preserved (`docs/SCOPE.md`) and split into phase prompts (`prompts/`).
- **Phase 1 (Architecture) complete** — full design in `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md`, including the
  reviewed-and-confirmed `InspectionResponse` snapshot strategy (§13.1).
- **Phase 2 (Database Design + full SQL) complete**, verified against a real local SQL Server
  instance (`localhost\SQLEXPRESS`, database `InspectIQDb`, Windows auth) — every layer, not just
  the table shapes:
  - `docs/DATABASE.md` — the 25-table design doc.
  - `database/00_CreateDatabase.sql`, `database/tables/01`–`08` — all 25 tables.
  - `database/constraints/09_Constraints.sql` — every enum `CHECK` constraint, plus 3
    `INSTEAD OF DELETE` triggers making the Phase 1 soft-delete-only requirement a real DB
    guarantee, not just a documented convention.
  - `database/indexes/10_Indexes.sql` — 43 non-clustered indexes.
  - `database/seed/11_SeedRoles.sql` (5 roles), `12_SeedInspectionTemplate.sql` (the Monthly
    Property Inspection template — 21 sections, 102 questions, per scope Prompt 4),
    `13_SeedSampleData.sql` (global default risk matrix as core config + 2 demo companies/4
    properties/11 units as local-dev-only data — `Users` deliberately NOT seeded yet, see below).
  - `database/views/14_InspectionViews.sql` — 5 reusable views (`vw_InspectionSummary`,
    `vw_OverdueInspections`, `vw_OpenMaintenanceIssues`, `vw_ActiveRiskAssessments`,
    `vw_PropertyUnitCounts`).
  - `database/reports/15_DashboardQueries.sql` — every scope §23 dashboard metric as a
    standalone, company-scoped, `ISNULL`-safe query, ready to lift into `DashboardRepository`
    in Phase 15.
  - `database/scripts/00_RunAll.sql` — **tested for real**: dropped `InspectIQDb` entirely and
    rebuilt it from nothing via this one script, then re-verified every count (25 tables, 5
    roles, 21 sections/102 questions, 2 companies/4 properties, 4 risk levels, 43 indexes, 3
    triggers, 5 views). It genuinely works end-to-end, not just "each file worked in isolation."
- **Phase 4 (FastAPI foundation) complete**, verified against the real `InspectIQDb` (not just
  "the code looks right"):
  - `backend/app/core/config.py` — `pydantic-settings`-based `Settings`, with the JWT-secret
    placeholder/length guard and `APP_DEBUG=False` default built in from day one (per
    `PROJECT_PLAN.md §12.2`, not retrofitted the way PropertyManager had to).
  - `backend/app/database/session.py` — SQLAlchemy engine/session, ODBC connection string
    builder supporting both Windows-trusted-connection (local dev) and SQL-auth-with-`Encrypt=yes`
    (production) branches.
  - `backend/app/models/base.py` — SQLAlchemy 2.0-style `DeclarativeBase`. No table models yet —
    those get added module-by-module starting Phase 5/6, not all at once.
  - `backend/app/core/exceptions.py` + handlers in `main.py` — domain exceptions
    (`NotFoundError`/`ValidationError`/`UnauthorizedError`/`ForbiddenError`/`ConflictError`) with
    HTTP status mapping; a catch-all handler that logs the real exception server-side but never
    returns it to the client.
  - `backend/app/core/logging_config.py`, `backend/app/api/health.py` — health check genuinely
    queries the DB (`SELECT 1`), not a stub that always returns 200.
  - `backend/tests/` — 6 tests, all passing against the real DB (no mocks): the health check
    over a real DB round-trip, and 5 tests exercising the JWT-secret guard (placeholder/short
    secret rejected outside dev, allowed in dev, real secret accepted, CORS origin parsing).
  - **Verified two ways**: `pytest` (in-process, via `TestClient`) AND a real `uvicorn` server
    started standalone and hit with actual `curl` over HTTP (`/api/health` and `/docs` both
    confirmed working), then cleanly stopped. Not just "tests pass" — the server genuinely runs.

## Currently being worked on

- Nothing in progress. Committing this batch to git is the next action.

## Important decisions

See `docs/AI_MEMORY.md` for the reasoning behind each; summarized in `docs/PROJECT_PLAN.md` and
`docs/DATABASE.md §9`. Real gotchas discovered while writing the actual SQL (not previously
documented, worth knowing for any future script against this schema):

1. **Any statement that creates or writes to a table with a `PERSISTED` computed column
   (`RiskAssessments.RiskScore`) OR a filtered index (`Properties.NextInspectionDue`,
   `Properties.PropertyStatus`, `MaintenanceIssues.DueDate`) needs `SET ANSI_NULLS ON` and
   `SET QUOTED_IDENTIFIER ON` in that session first**, or SQL Server rejects it (`Msg 1934`) —
   this bit `13_SeedSampleData.sql` on a plain `Properties` INSERT, not just `RiskAssessments`.
   SQLAlchemy/pyodbc set these by default, so the application itself won't hit this — but any
   hand-written script will.
2. **Filtered index predicates don't support `NOT IN`** (`Msg 102`) — use
   `x <> a AND x <> b` instead of `x NOT IN (a, b)`.
3. **`SUM(CASE...)` over zero matching rows returns `NULL`, not `0`.** Caught by actually
   running `15_DashboardQueries.sql` against a company with no maintenance/risk/cleaning data
   yet — every dashboard aggregate is wrapped in `ISNULL(..., 0)` as a result. A dashboard card
   must never render `NULL` as if it were an empty state.
4. **`RETURN` inside a `.sql` script only exits the current batch, not the whole script.** An
   idempotency guard (`IF EXISTS (...) BEGIN ... RETURN; END`) must be in the *same batch* as
   the logic it's meant to skip — a `GO` between the guard and the inserts silently defeats it.
   Caught in `12_SeedInspectionTemplate.sql` before it caused a real duplicate-data bug.

## Known bugs

None. The schema (tables, constraints, triggers, indexes, seed data, views, dashboard queries)
and the FastAPI foundation (config, DB connection, error handling, logging, health check) are
both implemented and verified against the real database and a real running server. One harmless
warning worth knowing about (not a bug): `pytest` shows a `StarletteDeprecationWarning` about
`httpx` vs a future `httpx2` package, from pairing a very new Starlette (1.6.0) with httpx
0.28.1. Doesn't affect anything now; revisit if a future dependency bump makes it a hard error.

## Database structure

Fully implemented — see `docs/DATABASE.md` for the design, `database/` for the SQL, all applied
and verified against a real local `InspectIQDb`. Both structural requirements from the Phase 1
sign-off are live and trigger-enforced. `RiskAssessments.RiskScore` is a verified-working
`PERSISTED` computed column. The default inspection template (21 sections/102 questions) and
global risk matrix are seeded; 2 demo companies with realistic property/unit data exist locally.

## Coding standards

Established and followed in the Phase 4 code: routes thin (see `app/api/health.py` — parses
nothing, just calls the DB dependency and returns a schema), no business logic in routes yet
since there isn't any yet, `app/schemas/` owns response shapes, `app/core/exceptions.py` owns
error-to-HTTP-status mapping so services (once they exist) never construct `HTTPException`
directly. Python 3.14, dependencies pinned with `>=` floors in `requirements.txt` (not exact
pins) — see `backend/README.md` for setup/run/test instructions.

## Next tasks

1. Commit this batch (backend/ foundation) to git.
2. Phase 5 — Authentication (`prompts/backend_prompt.md` table, Prompt 6): `Users`/`Roles` models
   in `app/models/`, password hashing (`bcrypt`, already installed) in `app/security/`, JWT
   encode/decode using `JWT_SECRET_KEY` (already validated/guarded in config), login endpoint,
   `get_current_user` dependency that re-checks `IsActive` every request (same pattern that
   caught a real deactivation-timing bug in PropertyManager).
3. **`Users` still needs seeding once real password hashing exists** — don't seed fake-hash demo
   users before then (see `database/seed/13_SeedSampleData.sql`'s header comment).

## Files that require attention

- `docs/DATABASE.md §10.1` (denormalized `CompanyId` drift risk) and `§10.4` (plaintext
  alarm/access codes) are real, not-yet-mitigated risks — worth remembering when writing the
  actual repository code in later phases, not just the SQL.
- Several `CHECK` constraints in `09_Constraints.sql` are marked `INTERPRETIVE` in comments
  (`Properties.PropertyStatus`, `CleaningInspections.Status`, `MaintenanceUpdates.UpdateType`,
  `RiskAssessments.Status`) — the scope doc mentions these fields without enumerating exact
  values, so a reasonable default list was chosen. Worth a quick sanity check against real usage
  once the app exists, not treated as scope-mandated.
